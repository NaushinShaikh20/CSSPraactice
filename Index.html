      <p>
        India is well known for its culture and its food. One of the famous is pulses. There are varieties of pulses such as Lentils, Chickpeas, MasoorDaal, Rajma or kidney beans, and Mung Daal. Each pulse has its own benefits. The most common benefits that each pulse has are protein and fiber. Pulses contain significant sources of vitamins and minerals such as iron, zinc, and magnesium. Pulses are considered the most healthy food.

      <p>
        Not only the main course but India's snacks are also healthy such as Dhokla, Moong Daal Chila, Idali with Sambhar and Batata Poha, Dhokla, Handva, and many more which can not be listed here. Here Batata Phoha can be the main discussion. Poha is made from rice flakes. It is rich in iron. It is a good gluten-free option for those with gluten intolerance. It is good in vitamins which keep blood pressure under control and low cholesterol which helps the heart to keep healthy.
